# Wallbox nodejs team offline technical test

Heey! If you're reading this it's because you've been selected to proceed for a Node.js related position at Wallbox ⚡! For this next step, you will need to carry out some offline assessments. This includes a questionnaire and a coding challenge. We've tried to explain everything you need to perform the tests in the markdown files. However, we might have written something that is confusing or missed some information that you consider is important to know. If so, do not hesitate to ask since it will also help us to improve our technical tests! Good luck 🍀!

## Code challenge

You will find all the instructions you need to perform the code challenge inside the `code-challenge` folder's [README.md](./code-challenge/README.md) file. Please, try to complete it in no more than 2 hours. We know that you probably could come up with a much better solution if you had plenty more time. We can discuss all possible improvements you can think of in the on-line coding session 🙂

## Questionnaire

Please, answer our short Questionnaire. You can add your answers in the same [questionnaire.md](./questionnaire.md) file. You should spend 5-10 minutes per question.

## Packaging

You should be packing all the challenge without modifying the structure, so you can create a `zip` file like so:

```
nodejs.name.surname     # Your name and surname prefixed with `nodejs`
├── .git                # Git root (In case you choose to use it)
├── code-challenge      # Code challenge folder.
│   ├── mocks
│   │   ├── charger
│   │   ├── device
│   ├── server
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── questionnaire.md    # Questionnaire
└── README.md           # This README.
```

## Important

Please, don't make the test public (like uploading it to GitHub).

We invested some thinking and shaping into this test and would like to be able to continue using it for future candidates like you.

## What's next?

We'll let you know something as soon as we have reviewed your tests. If you match our requirements we'll proceed with the next step: an online coding session 🤓 ! Otherwise, we'll try to give you our opinion on what we think it can be improved. We really value your time and effort doing these tests and since we are grateful for this and we value our candidates we'll try to provide the proper feedback you deserve 🙂 .

If you are notified to proceed with the hiring process, find here some useful resources we consider that can help you for the online coding session:

- Test that you can share your screen using your preferred browser.
- Have your offline coding challenge on hand.
- Be ready to code 💻 !
